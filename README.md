## All happy countries are alike. All unhappy countries are unhappy in their own way. Visualizing World Happiness Report data

This project is aimed at visualizing core relationships between happiness and socio-economic indicators, based on data from the World Happiness Report 2019[https://worldhappiness.report/ed/2019/]. This report is part of the initiative run by the United Nations Sustainable Development Solutions Network and represents the results of the survey of the state of global happiness. The whole report covers data across 156 countries during the 10 years time span. I focus on the latest data for 2018, which includes happiness scores and economic indicators for 136 countries.
<br>
The happiness score is the national average response to the question of life evaluations: “Please imagine a ladder, with steps numbered from 0 at the bottom to 10 at the top. The top of the ladder represents the best possible life for you and the bottom of the ladder represents the worst possible life for you. On which step of the ladder would you say you personally feel you stand at this time?” Happiness score is also known as subjective well-being, or life ladder. Other data included into analysis are GDP per capita, healthy life expectancy at birth, freedom to make life choices, generosity, and perception of corruption.
<br>
For the long time GDP per capita has been the major indicator used by economists to measure an economy’s well-being and performance. However, this indicator per se doesn’t reflect people’s wellbeing. In the recent years more and more economic research is focusing on revisiting the approach to measuring countries’ welfare and including behavioral data into account.

__The goal of my project is to find and visualize different relationships between the happiness (measure by happiness score) and socio-economic indicators__
